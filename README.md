## Overview

>In English, _tadka_ is known as “tempering.” It is the technique in which whole or ground spices are briefly roasted in oil or ghee in order to release their essential oils, thus making their flavor more aromatic.

Tadka is a static website generator starter kit, built with modern tools such as Webpack and Middleman.

## Installation

1. Clone this repo and navigate into the directory

2. Run `bundle install` to install all ruby dependencies.

3. Run `yarn install` to install all JS dependencies.

## Usage

During development run:

`middleman start` or `middleman s` to start the development server. This will also start Webpack's watcher.

Before pushing to production run:

`middleman build` or `middleman b` to build all your assets. For hosting, I strongly recommend [Netlify](https://netlify.com).
