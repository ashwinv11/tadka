      Welcome to Tadka! This is your homepage. You can create new pages in the source/views folder.
      You can also specify which layout files to use on a per page basis by adding the `layout: your_layout`
      to your page's YAML content. We also have the ability to add individual projects under the source/views/projects
      folder. Simply run `middleman article YOUR_TITLE` in your terminal window and voíla, you have a new project!

      To add page specific assets, create or use a custom layout file and import the bundle as needed. Webpack deals
      with our styles and javascript files, but things like images, fonts, and other assets are still controlled by Middleman.

      Gently heat the oil in a skillet and add the cinnamon sticks, green cardamom pods and cloves.
      When the cardamoms have turned white and the heads of the cloves have swollen,
      you are ready to stir in the mustard and cumin seeds. When they are sizzling, stir in the scallions,
      chiles, garlic and ginger.
